# Wheat Genome Assembly Utilities

This repository documents useful command-line operations used during genome assembly and analysis of wheat cultivars. These commands assist in identifying unanchored contigs after scaffolding, which are important for assembly quality metrics and manuscript reporting.

## Bash Commands for Counting Unanchored Contigs

Use these commands to count how many contigs in your final assembly FASTA file are **unanchored**, assuming you have **21 chromosome pseudomolecules** (1Aâ€“7D).

```bash
# Count total number of sequences (pseudomolecules + unanchored)
grep -c '^>' wheat+unanchored_contigs.fasta

# Subtract 21 chromosomes to get number of unanchored contigs
expr $(grep -c '^>' wheat+unanchored_contigs.fasta) - 21

# Preview first 10 contigs in the FASTA file
grep '^>' wheat+unanchored_contigs.fasta | head -n 10
